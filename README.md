# nmap_ssh_parser

Hello every one, here its nmap ssh parser, but make sure what you use nmap correctly , nmap output it must be  -oX,
and xml files you have to put in folder <nmap_ssh_parser/resource> , you can put from one to infinity files, my code parse all of them, and return in <nmap_ssh_parser/ip-result.txt> ! Good Luck Guys!
